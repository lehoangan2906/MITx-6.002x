When Does Dynamic programming Work?
- Optimal substructure: a globally optimal solution can be found by combining optimal solutions to local subproblems
    + For x > 1, fib(x) = fib(x - 1) + fib(x â€“ 2)
- Overlapping subproblems: finding an optimal solution involves solving the same problem multiple times 
    + Compute fib(x) or many times
